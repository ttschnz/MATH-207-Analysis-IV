# Analysis IV

These are my course notes from [MATH-405, Analysis IV](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/numerical-analysis-MATH-251-E), at EPFL in the Spring semester of 2025. The course is taught by G. Moschidis. The notes are written in LaTeX and are based on the course material and my understanding of it. The notes are not guaranteed to be correct and may contain errors. If you find any errors, please do let me know (see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below).
The course covers the following topics:

- Complex Analysis (Chapter 1)
    - Complex Differentiation
    - Complex integration
    - Laurent Series
    - Residue Theorem
- Fourier Series & Fourier Transform (Chapter 2)
- Laplace Transform on $[0,\infty[$ (Chapter 3)
- Applications: ODEs / PDEs (initial / boundary value problems) (Chapter 4)

The course is based on J. Rappaz's and M. Picasso's book "Introduction à l'analyse numérique" 3e édition, Ed. PPUR. Some contents of this script might be under their license.
